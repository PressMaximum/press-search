Bulk edit thousands of products data in the robust and flexible way!

== Description ==

Managing a store with hundreds of products is not easy. From time to time, you may need to decrease prices by 20% for a time based sale, add a tag to hundreds of products to optimize searches, etc.

No need to do it manually anymore - our bulk editor app is specialized at doing this kind of repetitive product/variant edit work accurately and quickly.


###Features:

* Filter products/variants to edit by collection, product type, tags, title, description, keywords, created time or any combination of these.
* Preview which products are going to be edited based on your filters.
* Edit price, compared at price, tags, title, description, vendor, product type, weight, inventory, description, SKU, barcode, SEO, title tag meta field, description tag meta field, Google Shopping related fields, variants, options, visibility, collection, Meta fields, HS tariff code, and almost all of the product/variation attributes.
* Review what products/variants have been edited with detailed logs.
